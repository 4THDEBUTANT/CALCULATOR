# CALCULATOR
IMPLIMENTATION
1:HTML Structure (index.html):
-Provides the UI with input fields for expressions and buttons for numbers, operations, and functions like square root and logarithm.

2:JavaScript (index.html):
-Handles user interactions by appending values to the input field, clearing it, and submitting the form for calculation.

3:PHP (calculate.php):
-Processes the mathematical expression submitted from index.html.
-Safely evaluates the expression, replacing ^ with ** for exponentiation and using regular expressions for functions like sqrt() and log().
-Returns the result to index.html after validation and evaluation.

4:Security Considerations:
-Input Validation: Ensures only valid mathematical expressions are processed to prevent security risks.

============================================================================================================================================

Accessing the Calculator
1:Ensure you have a web server running (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
2:Place both index.html and calculate.php in your web server's root directory (htdocs for Apache).
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost/..../index.html to access the calculator.

Using the Calculator
1:Enter numerical values and click on the corresponding buttons for operations.
2:Click "=" to calculate the result.
The result will be displayed in the input field.

Notes
1:Ensure valid mathematical expressions are entered to avoid errors.
2:The PHP script (calculate.php) evaluates the expression and redirects back to index.html with the result.
